Going to put my modelling stuff in here. I'll put what I've got so far for the DH table in this, as well as some tips to help define it. 

• θ: The angle between the x-axes of two consecutive frames, measured about the z-axis.
• d: The distance along the z-axis between two consecutive x-axes.
• a: The distance along the x-axis from one z-axis to the next.
• α: The angle between two consecutive z-axes, measured about the x-axis.
